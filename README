This class is an unofficial LaTeX implementation of the Europass CV, the
standard model for curriculum vitae as recommended by the European Commission.

The Europass CV replaces the European CV, launched in 2002. In 2013 a major
revision of the Europass CV came out, featuring a neater, more compact and
somewhat fancier layout. This class is an implementation of the 2013 version of
that layout.

The Europass CV defines both the content and the layout of a curriculum vitae.
The europasscv class provides support for the latter, and for the former as far
as personal information and spoken languages are concerned. This class tries to
be as close as possible to the standard model without sacrificing flexibility.

This ma足te足rial is sub足ject to the LATEX Project Public Li足cense Version 1.3.
